I'm closing up, I'm shutting down, I took a vow of silence.
You won't hear me from now on, you'll only see the violence.

I put some water into a pot and brought it to a boil.
I poured it on my arm without any reflex of recoil.
I made sure it'd miss my hand,
'Cause I need it to play in a band.
I thought I would scream,
But I didn't feel a thing.

Then I took some ice and the sharpest knife, and brought 'em to my room.
I sat there thinking of you and what I ought to do.
Then I picked a spot and numbed it up, 'cause carving can take some time,
Then I dug your name out of my skin, 'cause in my head, you're in my... mind
...mind.

Wo! I realized with some urgency, that all this is child's play.
I need to learn to speak in a more effective way.
But just what is the desired effect and why have I been stalling?
I want you to feel it, watch me now, I'm calling.

Over at the hospital, they will dress my wounds,
But they won't really heal, until they're touched by you.

Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo.
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo.
