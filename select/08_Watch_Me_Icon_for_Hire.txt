Watch me get it get it wrong at the top of my lungs
While you front for every one, while you tip toe for fun
I can scream until your ears bleed, you're gonna never hear me
You hear what you want, but you never wanted me
Careful, you don't wanna mess up, do you?
Fake brave face, I see right through you
Standing in place 'cause
Denial is the way to go, at least that's what you told me, so
Cover you ears when you don't wanna know
For whatever you hear you're held responsible
Are you scared you might open your mouth
And feel the horror if nothing comes out?
Do you think you're safe, frozen in place?
Run for cover just in case
I am not afraid to fall
You can watch me lose it all
I'll get it wrong, 'til I get it right
At least I'm making scenes in the meantime
Watch me, watch me
Watch me get it get it wrong at the top of my lungs
While you front for every one, while you tip toe for fun
I can scream until your ears bleed, you're gonna never hear me
You hear what you want, but you never wanted me
All eyes on you, we're watching you
It's too bad you're too stuck to move
Too bad you wouldn't know what to do
If the right thing walked right up to you
It's none steps forward, none steps back
No harm, no foul, you play like that?
Your game sucks, you need a new one
Your game sucks, make a new one up
Up the ante, up the drive,
Slow down - is this how you feel inside
Torn in the middle like you can't decide
Can't step up to save your life
I'm calling it, you're full of shh
More scared to make noise than you care to admit
Are you scared you might open your mouth
And feel the horror if nothing comes out?
Do you think you're safe, frozen in place?
Run for cover just in case
I am not afraid to fall
You can watch me lose it all
I'll get it wrong, 'til I get it right
At least I'm making scenes in the meantime
Watch me, watch me
No time left to play it safe, no time to bend
The worst mistake you'll ever make is trying to blend
Are you scared you might open your mouth
And feel the horror if nothing comes out?
Do you think you're safe, frozen in place?
Run for cover just in case
I am not afraid to fall
You can watch me lose it all
I'll get it wrong, 'til I get it right
At least I'm making scenes in the meantime
Watch me
Watch me get it get it wrong at the top of my lungs
While you front for every one, while you tip toe for fun
I can scream until your ears bleed, you're gonna never hear me
You hear what you want, but you never wanted me
